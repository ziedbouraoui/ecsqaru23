The biennial ECSQARU conferences constitute a major forum for advances in the theory and practice of reasoning under uncertainty, with a focus on bringing symbolic and quantitative aspects together. Contributions come from researchers interested in advancing scientific knowledge and from practitioners using uncertainty techniques in real-world applications. The scope of the ECSQARU conferences encompasses fundamental issues, representation, inference, learning, and decision-making in qualitative and numeric uncertainty paradigms.

### SCOPE 
For ECSQARU 2023 we invite submissions of original papers on topics which include but are not limited to:

- Algorithms for uncertain inference
- Applications of uncertain systems
- Argumentation systems
- Automated planning and acting under uncertainty
- Belief functions
- Belief change & merging
- Classification & clustering
- Decision theory & decision graphs
- Default reasoning
- Description logics with uncertainty
- Foundations of reasoning under uncertainty
- Fuzzy sets & fuzzy logic
- Game theory
- Hybrid reasoning
- Imprecise probabilities
- Inconsistency handling
- Information fusion - Learning for uncertainty formalisms
- Learning for uncertainty formalisms
- Logics for reasoning under uncertainty
- Markov decision processes
- Possibility theory & possibilistic logic
- Preferences
- Probabilistic graphical models
- Probabilistic logics
- Qualitative uncertainty models
- Rough sets
- Uncertainty & data

### PROCEEDINGS 

In accordance with the previous conferences, the proceedings of ECSQARU 2023 will be published in the Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence series. In addition to that, extended versions of selected papers will be published in a special issue of the International Journal of Approximate Reasoning.


### SUBMISSIONS

Authors are requested to prepare their conference papers in the LNCS/LNAI format. Submitted papers must be original and not under review in a journal or another venue with formally published proceedings. They will be evaluated by peer reviews based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of exposition. Authors of accepted papers are expected to attend the conference to present their work, at least one author of each paper must register for the conference.

Submitted papers must be at most 10 pages (excluding references) in the Springer LNCS/LNAI format. Submissions will be through EasyChair.
