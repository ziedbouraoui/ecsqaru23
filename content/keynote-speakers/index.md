He is particularly well known for his work on sports analytics, which has attracted significant interest from practitioners and the media. Prior to joining KU Leuven, he obtained his bachelor’s degree from Williams College, his PhD from the University of Wisconsin, and completed a post-doc at the University of Washington.
